<br> I believe God  has made me come this far, starting from my individual achievements plus my achievements <br>
<br> of being in a group. I trained really hard to become a fashion designer and i've seen the fruits of my labour <br>
<br> For three consecutive years i've won the individual Fashonista of the year three times. <br>
<br> </p>
<p> Also, i one a group award with my colleagues as best fashion models of the month twice <br>
<br> also i still appreciate God for what i have been able to acheive so far</br>
